# Data-Professional-Survey-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI

We have created a dashboard using Power Bi to illustrate the key findings of a data professional survey. The data is survey of people who are in the data field. Key data points are salary, job title, happiness with salary, work life balance etc. We also have demographics data of survey takers such as country, age, gender, highest level of education, and ethnicity.

Firstly I have performed data cleaning to remove some unnecessary columns, and standardise data in Power Query.

Next, I have created visualisations to illustrate key points from the data such as happiness with work life balance, happiness with salary, total survey takers, average salary by job title, etc.
